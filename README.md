# reactStreamy

This application is a basic video streaming application using React & Redux.

This application was created through an online course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/

## To get this running:
### First:
Fork/Clone the repository.

### Second:
Open 3 seperate terminal tabs, and open each project directory.

### Third:
Run command: 
`npm start` In each terminal.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Through this project I further expanded my knowledge in React/Redux through: 
* Redux store design
* Navigation with React Router
* Handling authentication with React (& Google)
* Redux Dev Tools
* Handling Forms with Redux Form
* REST-based React apps
* Using React Portals
* And Implementing Streaming of videos through OBS
